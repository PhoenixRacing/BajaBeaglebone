you need to run this on startup:

echo T8LO-GPS > /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.*/slots

and

gpsd -F /var/run/gpsd.sock /dev/ttyO4

if this is your first time running this, you need to compile the device tree overlay file (found in this dir)
and add the compiled .dtbo to /lib/firmware first

dtc -@ -I dts -O dtb -o T8LO-GPS-00A0.dtbo T8LO-GPS-00A0.dts

also you need to install the gpsd stuff (to make the python work)

sudo apt-get update && apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients ntp

if you're unsure if things are working run

cgps
